# kqed_for_apple_tv
I was annoyed that the Apple Music app for Apple TV took so many clicks to get to the KQED live stream, so I built an app to do it in just one.

This is really just a proof of concept for me, in addition to solving a minor but persistent annoyance - namely the Apple Music app for Apple TV, somewhat understandably, makes it more complicated to get to third-party streaming stations than it does it's own offerings.

Built with in Swift with Alamofire via Cocoapods. 

This app should be easily compiled in Xcode and likely run on your Apple TV with a bit of work - YMMV.

Neither this app nor it's developer is in any way affiliated with KQED radio - though he's clearly a big fan.
